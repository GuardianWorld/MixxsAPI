# MixxsAPI

A collection of tools made by myself to help me mod Minecraft Beta 1.7.3.
Simply helps with stuff.

So far done:

MixxsAPI     - V0.1a (Proof of concept)

ItemAPI      - V0.2a (Check bellow:)

RecipeAPI    - N/A

LootTableAPI - N/A

EntityAPI    - N/A

StructureAPI - N/A

Others       - N/A


## ItemAPI:
  It is possible to create items via a .txt file and simply placing the textures inside the MixxsAPI.zip file, instead of needing to code the items in.
  
  Supports the following Items:
  * Custom Enum Materials (If OverrideAPI is found)
  * Default Items
  * Food Items (With extra properties~)
  * SOUP with custom return items as well~
  * Equipment/Tools (Sword, Axe, Pickaxe, Shovel, Hoe) and a way of creating full equipment sets of a single material very easily.
  * Bows
  * Shears with custom pickable blocks (Uses a workaround to grab unobtainable items with silk-touch style.)
  * Armor, with a way of creating a full set as well all at once.
  * Flint and Steel
  * Block Placers (Same code as Flint And Steel really, just with a different sound!)
  * Block Replacers (Can replace almost all blocks with the one specified, you do lose the block you are replacing, but can be useful to fix buildings).
    
    How to create everything is on the example itemAPI.txt file, modify it if you want to add an item of your own~
